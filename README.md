===============

The Pomodoro Technique (http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) it's a focus
technique to help you get stuff done. Not getting into any details, you split
your work time in 25-minute sections separated by breaks. Each session is
devoted to a single objective, which must be defined clearly and explicitely. No
distractions or interruptions are allowed. Any semblance of interference must be
left to deal with in the next break. 

This application allows us to keep track of the pomodoro session we have done
during each day. For this we use the RedNotebook, a note taking application
which applies the concept of one note per day. The data for this application is
stored in text files, one per month, contained in ~/.rednotebook/data. 

We are going to read and parse this data and export it to a Google Spreadsheet,
where we can sort and graph our data at will.
